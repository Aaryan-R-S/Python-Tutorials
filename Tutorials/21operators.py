# 1. Arithmetic Operators --

# print(5+2)
# print(5-2)
# print(5*2)
# print(5/2)
# print(5**2)  POWER
# print(5//2)  QUOTIENT
# print(5%2)   REMAINDER

# 2. Assignment Operators --
# x = 5 
# x+=2
# print(x)
# x-=2
# print(x)
# x*=2
# print(x)
# x/=2
# print(x)

#3. Comparison Operators --
# x = 5
# print(x==5)
# print(x!=5)
# print(x>=5)
# print(x<5)

#4.Logical Operator
# a = True
# b = False
# print(a and b)
# print(a or b)

#5.Identity Operator --
# a = True
# b = False
# print(a is not b)
# print(a is b)
# print(a is 5)

# 6. Membership Operator --
# q = [3,353,35,3,24,2,7,0,78]
# print(3 in q)
# print(34 in q)

# 7. Bitwise Operator (Binary)--
# print(0 or 1)
# print(0 and 1)
# print(2 or 1)     # 2 = 10 or 1 = 01   -- 11 = 2
# print(2 and 1)    # 2 = 10 and 1 = 01   -- 01 = 1
